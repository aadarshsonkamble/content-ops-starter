      Cancellation Policy


      *Last updated: 16/2/2025*


      At CutCraft, we are dedicated to supporting our customers by offering a
      liberal cancellation policy. Please review the following guidelines
      carefully:


      ## Cancellation Request Window


      *   Cancellation requests will be considered only if made within **9-15
      days** of placing your order.


      ## Conditions for Cancellation


      *   **Order Processing:** Cancellation may not be possible if the order
      has already been communicated to our vendors/merchants and the shipping
      process has been initiated.


      *   **Perishable Items:** We do not accept cancellation requests for
      perishable items such as flowers or eatables.


      *   **Product Quality:** If you believe the product received is not as
      shown on our site or does not meet your expectations, please notify our
      Customer Service within **9-15 days** of receipt. Our team will review
      your complaint and take appropriate action.


      ## Refunds and Replacements


      *   **Damaged or Defective Items:** In case you receive damaged or
      defective items, please report the issue immediately to our Customer
      Service team. Refunds or replacements will be processed once the vendor or
      merchant confirms the problem.


      *   **Refund Processing:** Once a refund is approved by CutCraft, it will
      take **9-15 days** for the refund to be processed and credited back to
      you.


      *   **Warranty Issues:** For products that come with a manufacturer's
      warranty, please contact the manufacturer directly for any related issues.


      If you have any questions or need further assistance regarding
      cancellations or refunds, please reach out to our Customer Service team.
